CDL calculation


CDL, which stands for Composite Diffuse Layer, is a model to expain the structure of an electric double layer capacitance (EDLC - supercapacitor/energy storage device). This code is a part of my phd work, where we extend the CDL model to calculate the total free energies and derive analytical approximation to a rather complex highly mean field theories to describe the differential and integral capacitances, and total free energies of an EDLC. The code is based on the work titled "The impact of steric repulsion on the total free energy of electric double layer capacitors" which is accepted for publication in 'Colloids and Surfaces A' journal.
